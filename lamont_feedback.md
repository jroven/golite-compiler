## General Feedback 

You still have too many AST node definitions. The purpose of the AST is to reduce the number nodes coming from the ANTLR parse tree. I provide some recommendations in the next section towards a fix. 

## Recommendations of Changes 
A have a few recommendations of changes 

- Many of your plural ast node definitions (e.g., arguments.go, ids.go, parameters.go) can be converted into making those slices be part of the singular form ast nodes. For example, you have the following 

```go 
type Parameters struct {
	*token.Token
	Decls []*Decl
}
```
But this can be easily converted into the following 

```go 
type Function struct {
	*token.Token
	id           *Variable
	params       []*Decl 
	returnType   []*ReturnType // maximum length 1
	declarations []*Declaration
	stms         []Statement
}
```
Now there's no need to define parameters.go, ids.go because they can be just slices of the singular form.
